<html><body><p>Alpha v1.3.0</p><p>As the final alpha release for the project&#x27;s 2023 development cycle, this version contains various final fixes and minor adjustments to ensure both the Chemical and Radiation gamemodes function properly. The biggest bug fixed in this version is for objects using the paintable shader, which now properly renders in both eyes thanks to an adjustment in the rendering mode. With this fix, the Chemical gamemode is now fully playable again.</p><p>In addition to the rendering fix, the end scenario details for the Chemical gamemode have been implemented which includes markers for each contaminant site on the end map screen as well as a list of all the chemicals spawned in the level.</p><p>Changelog:</p><ul><li>Switched rendering path from Single Pass Instanced to Multi-pass to fix materials using the Paintable shader only rendering in one eye with the built-in pipeline</li><li>Added end scenario details for Chemical Hunt gamemode</li><li>(Chemical) Added new map markers for contaminant sites that scale depending on chemical spread alongside an icon for whether the site was cleared or missed</li><li>(Chemical) Decreased spawn rate of Acetaminophen as it was spawning way too frequently</li><li>(Chemical) Increased possible spill radius range of various sites within the Garage scene</li><li>(Chemical) Fixed some graphical errors in Garage scene where objects were appearing too smooth/reflective</li></ul><p>Getting Started</p><p><strong>Installation</strong></p><p>Before installing and running the application, please ensure you have the following:</p><ul><li>A compatible personal computer (PC) or laptop with at least one Universal Serial Bus (USB) or USB-C port.</li><li>The Meta Quest Developer Hub (MQDH) application installed on your PC or laptop.</li><li>A Meta Quest 2 (formally known as Oculus Quest 2) with either a  or Facebook account.</li><li>A cable with one connection matching the port on your PC or Laptop, and one connection being a USB-C to plug into the Quest 2.</li><li>Internet (Ethernet or Wi-Fi Connection)</li></ul><p>The following steps describe how to install and run the VR Sampling Training Simulator. These steps assume that you have already downloaded the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Virtual Reality (VR) Sampler Alpha folder onto your computer, completed the initial set up of your Meta Quest 2, created a Meta account or linked a Facebook account to the headset, and have enabled Developer Mode. </p>
<ul><li>Download the  file. Note that you will need to request access to the GitHub repository. </li><li>Ensure your Meta Quest 2 is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your PC or laptop. </li><li>Enable Developer Mode within the Quest 2 headset. If not already enabled, please see the “Enabling Developer Mode” below for additional steps.</li><li>Connect your headset to the device you downloaded the APK file on using the USB or USB-C cable.</li><li>Using the MQDH application, navigate to the Device Manager tab and select your Quest 2 from the list, then use the “Add Build” button to install the APK file you downloaded in step 1.</li></ul><p><strong>Run the Application</strong></p><p>Put on your Meta Quest 2 headset.</p><p>Navigate to the Library in your headset&#x27;s menu.</p><p>In the upper right corner should be a dropdown menu that currently says All. Click on the dropdown and select the &quot;Unknown Sources&quot; option. This is where apps installed outside the Oculus Store appear.</p><p>Find and select the &quot;EPA VR Sampler Alpha&quot; app to start it.</p>
<p><strong>Enabling Developer Mode</strong></p><p>The first step to enabling developer mode is to join or create an organization. If you know of an existing Meta Organization that you can join, request access from the admin to join. Otherwise, you need to go to the  website to create a new organization.</p><p>Once you have joined or created an organization, you need to verify your account. You can do this through the  website by either setting up SMS two-factor verification on your account, or by adding a valid payment method to your account.</p><p>Once you have verified your account, you can use that account to turn on developer mode in your headset. Do this in the headset by navigating to Settings, then System, then Developer and turning on the USB Connection Dialog option. Alternatively, you can use the Meta Quest Mobile App that you used when setting up the headset by selecting the device, selecting Headset Settings, Selecting Developer Mode, and turning it on from there.</p><p>Once Developer Mode is enabled, you can connect to your PC or Laptop using the USB or USB-C cable while the headset is on. There will be some popups in the headset checking if you want to trust this connected device, select yes if you plan on installing the APK file from the connected device.</p><p><strong>Navigation and Control</strong></p><p>The VR Sampling Training Simulation uses the Meta Quest 2 controllers to track your arm and hand movements. Figure 1 shows the controllers and button layout.<img src="controls.png" alt="Controller Layout">
</p><p>Main Menu Operations</p><p>From the main menu room, you can explore the movement feature and interact with the “White Board.” You can use either controller to point towards the white board, causing a laser pointer to appear to interact with the selectable menu buttons (Figure 2).<img src="main menu.png" alt="Main Menu"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>

</p><p></p><p>The Main Menu options are:</p><ul><li><strong>START: </strong>Once you are ready, select this button to proceed to the Scenario Selection screen.</li><li><strong>OPTIONS: </strong>Select this button to adjust current height calibration settings. This setting is also available later in the training through a virtual User Tablet (See User Tablet).</li><li><strong>EXIT:</strong> This button will bring up a prompt asking if you would like to exit the application. If you accept, the application will close, and you can remove the headset.</li></ul><p>Upon selecting the start button, the White Board will display the Scenario Selection Menu (Figure 3). Select your preferred agent and map/environment.<img src="map select.png" alt="Map Selection"></p><p></p><p>Figure 3. Scenario Selection Menu displaying two available environments to select from.</p><p>Once you have selected a scenario and pressed the Play button, the training simulation will begin. You will spawn into your selected scenario, and a timer will start.</p><p>Disclaimer</p><p>This software was developed with support from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) under IAA No. 70RSAT21KPM000048 and with the assistance of RTI International under EPA Contract No.<strong> 68HERC21D0004, EPA Order No. 68HERC22F0274 (Use of Virtual Reality to Support Training Activities)</strong>.
