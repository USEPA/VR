2.7

Fixed an issue with the input manager where OVRInputs wouldn't work if the controller connected late.
Fixed an issue where sockets with overlapping triggers would infinitely grab the socket out of it's neighbor.
HVRGrabbable - OriginalCollisionMode, WasGravity, Was Kinematic setters set to public so they can be modified by user while grabbed.
Barebones Scene - added OpenXR Rig variant.
Tweaked hand inertia tensor and default wrist strength.


Haptics Updates:
	Haptics fields removed from HVRForceGrabber and HVRHandGrabber and moved to HVRGrabHaptics scriptable object that can be set on the HVRInputManager
	InputSystem Controller updated for OpenXR 1.3 where they finally updated full haptic functionality which allows haptic frequency adjustments.
	HVRGunBase: Added HVRGunHaptics Scriptable Object and HapticsGrabbable field that let's you decide which other grabbable on the gun will vibrate the hand holding it.
	HVRGrabbableImpactHaptics & HVRHandImpactHaptics - adds collision haptics to grabbable and the physics hands. Uses HVRImpactHaptics scriptable object for haptics settings.
 	HVRInputManager - Updated with HVRGrabHaptics settings reference.
	Example prefabs updated with new haptic components.

New Scriptable Objects:

	HVRImpactHaptics:
		Timeout : time before another haptic vibration is allowed since the last.
		Sqr Mag Threshold : post collision velocity threshold required to vibrate.
		Amp Curve: animation curve used to scale haptic amplitude by collision force.
		Max Force: Collision force is divided by this value and fed into the amp curve.
		Duration: Haptic Duration
		Frequency: Haptic Frequency
		
	HVRGunHaptics:
		DryFire: haptic when pulling trigger with empty gun.
		Fire: when the gun shoots.
		Trigger Released: when trigger drops below pull threshold.
		Trigger Squeezed: constant haptics while trigger is being pulled.
		Cocking Handle Eject: when eject threshold is met.
		Cocking Handle Chambered Round: when chambered round threshold hit.
		Cocking Handle Released: when cocking handle is released.
		Ammo Socketed: when a magazine enters the mag socket.
		Ammo Socket Released: when mag socket releases it's object.
	
	
	HVRGrabHaptics:
		Hand Grab: when hand joint attaches
		Hand Release: when dropping object
		Hand Hover: when hand hovers and object
		Force Grab: when force grabber starts grabbing
		Force Hover: when force grabber hovers



2.6.3

Tweaked wrist strength to be more responsive
Added box collider to the tech demo hands.
Fixed an issue with the hand indicators not showing due to remote grab and hand grab sharing the same one.
Gun Creator 
	-HVRRequireOtherGrabbable added to the dummy magazine grabbable linked to main grabbable
	-PhysicsPoserFallback set to false on dummy mag grab to fix grab indicator used.
	-Example guns updated.


2.6

Major improvements to dynamic pose grabbing:
	- When force grabbing the palm will align towards the collider to help prevent finger overlap.
	- Dynamic grab now works with the "Hand Grabs" feature where the hand can move to the object.
	- Fingers now smoothly bend to their dynamic pose instead of snapping immediately
	- Grabbable objects now smoothly come into the hand instead of snapping immediately
	
Hand Pose Editor: 
 	- Updated to show the bone gizmos while preview hands are active, even if another object is selected.	
	- Issues with gizmos not showing up when more than one inspector is open should be fixed.

New VRIK Setup Window - tutorial to follow
New Custom Hand Setup Window - tutorial to follow 

HVRHandGrabber:
	- CloneHandModel will no longer clone the skinned mesh renderer, it will instead create an invisible hand clone for collision purposes only leaving the original intact without colliders.
	- Tweaked default throwing velocity factors on tech demo hands.
	- Fixed layer reset after a dynamic grab when all collider layers weren't the same to begin with.
	- DynamicPoseIndicatorMode - chose behaviour of grab indicators when dynamic posing would occur: (None, Transform Position, Palm Position)
	- DynamicPoseIndicator - grab indicator override when hovering with dynamic posing
	- Hand Collision with a released object will re-enable immediately for objects without a rigidbody, or a rigidbody that's kinematic.
	- Fixed an issue where BreakDistance was checking too early before the grab joint was made.
	- Grip grab being active will prevent Hovering a grabbable.
	
HVRGrabbable: 
	- ParentHandModel now defaulted to false
	- RigidBody can now be assigned, useful for compound objects like guns with secondary holds.
	- AutoApplying Grabbable layer will now stop recursing down the tree if another HVRGrabbable is found, and will be performed in Start instead of Awake.
	- SetupColliders() made public for users who add colliders after start to the object can reset the known collider list.
	- Colliders / AdditionalIgnoreColliders changed to lists instead of arrays for runtime modification.
	- RequireOverlapClearance defaulted to false
	- OverlapTimeout lowered to .20

HVRPosableGrabPoint: Add Check Distance and MaxDistance fields which which can invalidate grab points based on pose to hand distance.
HVRStabber: Now checks if HVRStabbable component is enabled or not, allowing you to disable stabbing of certain objects dynamically.
HVRScreenFade: FadeStart / FadeEnd events
SFXPlayer: code using the singleton updated to check it's existence first.

Example scene Demo UI updated with a Pause example.	
Gun Example prefabs are updated to use just one RigidBody, stabilizer / pump grabbables now use the main rigidbody for jointing.
Gun Creator updated to only use one grabbable RigidBody instead of two with a joint.
